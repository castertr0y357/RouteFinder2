# Project Status - RouteFinder2

## 🎯 Current Objectives
- None (All current objectives met).

## 🚀 Completed Features
- Fixed issue where the AI settings page did not display the new service provider, API URL, and model fields due to the Service Worker caching the profile page.
- Incremented PWA cache version to `routefinder-v4` to force a cache purge and update across client browsers.
- Added comprehensive unit tests (`ProfileViewTests`) to verify the rendering of the AI settings fields on the profile page.
- Baseline project setup and environment diagnostics.
- Fixed syntax error in `views.py` and updated `tests.py` to match current signatures.
- Implemented AI Settings in User Profile with a tabbed UI (Address, Defaults, AI Settings).
- Added switch toggles for AI Enablement, AI Deep Thinking, and a range slider for Thinking Effort (1-100).
- Integrated user profile settings into `AIService` to bypass queries when disabled and apply thinking configurations (think parameter, custom instruction budget, temperature adjustment).
- Fixed a `TemplateSyntaxError` on the Discover page caused by an unclosed `{% if perform_search %}` tag and malformed `div`/`script` elements.
- Added support for custom Ollama URLs, custom models, and standard OpenAI-compatible API URLs by introducing `ai_provider`, `ai_api_url`, `ai_model`, and `ai_api_key` fields to `UserProfile`.
- Updated the profile settings page dynamically to show/hide provider-specific settings (e.g. hiding API key for Ollama, updating Base URL label).
- Updated `UserProfile` and related database models to declare index properties explicitly using `db_index=True` on ForeignKey and OneToOneField relationships.
- Refactored monolithic views logic by splitting `views.py` into a clean package (`views/base_views.py`, `views/discovery_views.py`, `views/auth_views.py`, `views/__init__.py`).
- Set up a startup diagnostics process in `apps.py` to perform database pre-flight checks and validate critical configurations (e.g. Google Maps key, Secret Key validation).
- Implemented typing annotations across all python models, services, backends, forms, and views.
- Introduced `MOCK_MODE=True` settings and service support to geolocode, query listings/clusters, solve TSP route coordinates, and analyze targets completely offline.
- Added a diagnostic health utility script `doctor.py`.
- Developed database backup and restoration script `backup_db.py` (with SQLite/PostgreSQL, timestamping, and compression support) and documented it in `README.md`.
- Excluded the `backups/` directory in `.gitignore`.
- Configured non-root execution permissions for container security in `Dockerfile`.
- Partitioned development volume mounts out of `docker-compose.yml` into `docker-compose.override.yml`.

## 🛠️ Active Tasks
- None

## 📌 Architectural Notes
- Database: SQLite (local testing), PostgreSQL (docker production)
- Verification Command: `$env:DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///db.sqlite3"; python manage.py test`
